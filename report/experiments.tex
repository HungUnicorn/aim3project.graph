\subsection{Apache Flink}
Apache Flink is a large-scale data processing engine optimal to process large amounts of data. It offers APIs for Java, Scala and hadoop MapReduce as well as various APIs to access data. Flink programs can be run locally on a single machine or on a cluster of multiple nodes. When ran on cluster, load distribution and fault tolerance are handled by Apache Flink independently with few configuration effort. Flink enables processing huge amount of data while offering an easy to use API for programmers to implement algorithms.

\subsection{Web Data Commons}
The Web Data Commons is project of the University of Mannheim which is supported by the European Union, Amazon Web Services in Education Grant Award and by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The project offers data sets of the web graph to the public. The data sets were extracted from the Common Crawl Foundation which provides a web corpus to the public.

\subsection{Data sets}
There are multiple data sets offered by the Web Data Commons project differed by year and aggregation level. They offer the Hyperlink Graph 2012 and Hyperlink Graph 2014. Due to different crawling strategies which were used to gather the web corpora, the authors suggest to use the Hyperlink Graph 2012 for comprehensive network analysis of the web graph.

For the Hyperlink Graph 2012 there are the following four different aggregation levels. Page Graph, Subdomain/Host Graph, 1st Subdomain Graph and Pay-Level Domain Graph (PLD).

The Page-Level Graph represents every web page with all details as single node in the graph. An example for a node in this graph would be: dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/database\_ systems\_ and\_ information\_ management\_ group/

The Host Graph aggregates the Page Graph by the subdomains and hosts. Therefore, each subdomain is represented as node within the Host Graph. The two pages tu-berlin.de and dima.tu-berlin.de are two different nodes within this graph.

The PLD reduces the Host Graph by merging the subdomains with their host. The two nodes tu-berlin.de and dima.tu-berlin.de are represented in the PLD as a single node tu-berlin.de.

It is obvious that the size of the graphs decreases with the increase of the granularity level. The graphs are separated into two different files, namely an index file and an arc file. The index file consists of tuples which hold an identifier and the node name. The arc file gives tuples of two identifiers representing a link from one node to another. An overview of the different sizes is given by the following table.

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Number of Nodes and Arcs}
	\label{t2}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
			\hline
			Data Set	&\#Nodes	&\#Arcs \\ \hline
			Page Graph	&1,727M	&64,422M	\\	\hline
			Subdomain/ Host Graph	&22M	&123M	\\	\hline		
			PLD Graph	&13M	&56M	\\	\hline				
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Computation}
It was initially planned to run the computations of the algorithms on a ten node cluster. Therefore, it was initially intended to use the Host Graph as data set to achieve a comprehensive  analysis of the web graph. Unfortunately, due to organizational problems running the computation on the ten node cluster was not possible.

As a fallback plan, the decision was made to run the computations locally on regular machines. Very first steps however, revealed that computing these amount of data on a single machine is not feasible, since those machines do not have enough memory. Hence, a reduction of the data set to the PLD was made. This reduction enabled the computation of the indegree distribution and the Top-K outdegree of the PLD. These results were achieved on a machine with 3GB RAM and 2 processors with 2 cores. The computation took around 40 minutes. 

Other implemented algorithms such as the PageRank, closeness and betweenness could not be executed since said machines ran out of memory during the computation.

During the course of the project an opportunity arised to run the algorithms on a four node cluster. A detailed view on the configuration of the four node cluster can be seen in Figure \ref{fig6a}. This time the Host Graph as well as the PLD Graph as fallback was used. The computation of the indegree and outdegree was successful on the four node cluster. For both graph levels it was possible to retrieve results. Nevertheless, the other algorithms to measure the connectivity, PageRank and closeness of the graph faced memory issues on the four node cluster.

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Evaluation}
To rapidly test the implementations of the different algorithms an example data set was used that was provided by the Web Data Commons project. This data set contains 106 nodes and 141 arcs. The Web Data Commons project provides results for the indegree and outdegree (see Figure \ref{fig8} and \ref{fig9}). A comparison to these results show that our implementation in respect to the indegree and outdegree is correct and computes the expected results.

\section{Results}
The results of the computations made by this project are very limited due to the lack of computation power. Results from the computation of the indegree and outdegree have been achieved which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig12} and Figure \ref{fig13}. The results of our indegree distribution show the power-law. Yet, it is observable that whether the indegree distribution nor the outdegree distribution follow a strict linear regression, therefore, a regression ANOVA was applied in order to confirm or reject the significance of a power-law.

		\caption{Outdegree distribution}	
	\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The regression ANOVA (see Figure \ref{fig14}) reveals that the p-value is significant which is 0. However, one of the residual plots, which is the relationship between fitted value (predicted value) and residual, indicates the line is not a regression line (see Figure \ref{fig15}). The reason there is that the residuals have patterns, which violates the assumption of regression that the residuals must have no patterns. Besides, the data also does not follow the assumption that should be normal distribution based on the probability graph. In conclusion, the power-law is not significant. We can therefore confirm the results of other research [4].

The results of the Top-10 indegree computation can be seen in Table \ref{t4a}. Further, see Table \ref{t4} for the results of the Top-10 outdegree computation. These results are also confirmed by the Web Data Commons project \footnote{Topology of the 2012 WDC Hyperlink Graph.
