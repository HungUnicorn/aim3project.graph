The goals of this project have been partly achieved. The implementation of the algorithms in order to compute the different measures have been fully completed. An evaluation of these algorithms showed that the implementations produce correct results. For this evaluation an example data set was used to rapidly test the algorithms. Due to lack of computation power, we reduced the granularity from the Host Graph to the PLD. A comprehensive network analysis of the Web Graph was only limited feasible. However, a few results could be obtained from the computation. These information were gained previously in other projects. Those results could be partly confirmed by our results.

The developed algorithms implemented with the help of the Java API of Apache Flink can be used to retrieve the measures in other networks. Additional optimizations of the implementations can be achieved. The computations can be also run on a multiple node cluster to gain more results.
